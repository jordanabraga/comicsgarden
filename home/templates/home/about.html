            <p>
                Born out of a passion for storytelling and a love for the vibrant world of comics, Comics Garden sprouted in 2020 from the imaginations of two lifelong friends, Dana and Jordana. Tired of the cookie-cutter corporate stores, they envisioned a cozy, quirky space where fans could discover new stories, share their favorites, and geek out without judgment. Whether you're hunting for the latest indie hit or a hidden gem from the golden age, you'll find it here.
